Scramble the letters of words in a string so that the first 
and last letters remain the same, but middle letters are 
rearranged. Don't let words remain unchanged unless they 
are too short to change.

Example:
```
The time has come, the walrus said, to talk of many things
-->
The tmie has cmoe, the wluars siad, to tlak of mnay tihngs
```
